# :money_with_wings: Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that has a credit card credit dataset.  This project uses various techniques of oversampling, undersampling, and combination-sampling (bias reduction) approaches to predict credit risk.  

## :credit_card: Purpose of this analysis:
The purpose is to evaluate the performance of these models and make recommendations on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
